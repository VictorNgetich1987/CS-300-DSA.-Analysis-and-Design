Project Reflection

The primary problem addressed in this course was understanding how different data structures and algorithms impact program efficiency, readability, and scalability. Through Project One, I analyzed the run-time and memory usage of various data structures to determine how each performs under different conditions. In Project Two, I applied this knowledge by developing working code that sorts and prints a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order. Together, these projects focused on solving problems related to data organization, performance optimization, and algorithm selection.

My approach to solving these problems was methodical and concept-driven. I began by breaking down each requirement and identifying which data structures were most appropriate based on efficiency and ease of implementation. Understanding why data structures matter—particularly in terms of time complexity and memory usage—helped guide my design decisions. Rather than focusing only on making the program work, I considered how efficiently it would perform as data size increased.

Throughout the projects, I encountered roadblocks related to algorithm logic, syntax errors, and understanding how data structures behave internally. I overcame these challenges by revisiting course materials, testing smaller portions of code, and iteratively refining my solutions. Debugging step by step and validating outputs helped me build confidence and ensured accuracy in my implementations.

Working on these projects expanded my overall approach to designing software and developing programs. I now place greater emphasis on planning before coding, selecting appropriate data structures early, and thinking through algorithm efficiency from the start. This course helped me shift from a trial-and-error mindset to a more structured and analytical development process.

Additionally, these projects significantly improved the way I write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. I adopted clearer variable naming, modular logic, and consistent formatting, making my programs easier to understand and modify. These practices will be valuable in future coursework and professional development, especially when working on larger or collaborative software projects.
